Developed a system that helps quadriplegic patients control devices like wheelchairs and lights using voluntary movements such as head tilts, eye blinks, and jaw clenches. The system uses multiple sensors for detecting movements, with noise filtering and debouncing logic to ensure valid inputs. A Finite State Machine (FSM) is implemented to handle system states, triggering specific actions based on detected movements. The system is designed to process inputs and control various devices for assistive purposes. Tech: Verilog (FSM and Debouncing Logic), Multiple Sensors (Head Tilt, Eye Blink, Jaw Clench), Signal Filtering
